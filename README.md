ðŸŽ® The SQSR (SerÃ¡ que sou ruim? / Am I really bad?) project
Welcome to The SQSR This is my adventure into the world of data analysis, gaming, and, well, a little bit of chaos with the Riot Games API. If you're here, you're probably as curious and excited as I am about figuring out how League of Legends players tickâ€”and maybe how to improve your own game along the way!

ðŸŒŸ What is This?
In short, this project is all about collecting and analyzing data from League of Legends matches to help players understand their strengths, weaknesses, and everything in between. Itâ€™s a journey through data, stats, and more importantly, growth as a player.

I started this project with a simple goal: to analyze the last 20 games of a summoner and compare their stats with higher elo benchmarks. But, as with any good project, things quickly escalated. Now, Iâ€™m diving deep into match details, storing tons of data in a SQL Server database, and learning way more than I ever expected about both coding and the game.

ðŸš€ The Journey So Far
Data Collection: Fetching match data from the Riot Games API was the first hurdle. Iâ€™ve written scripts in Python that pull match details, store them in a SQL Server database, and keep everything organized.

Database Setup: My database now houses over 100,000 lines of match details, with a focus on Diamond league games. This is the foundation for all the analysis that follows.

Analysis: The fun part! Iâ€™m working on tools to crunch the numbers and find out what separates the best players from the rest. Whether it's champion picks, positioning, or playstyle, I'm on it.

Iterating and Learning: Every step has been full of surprises. Iâ€™ve broken code, fixed it, and broken it again. But every bug is a new lesson, and every fix is a small victory.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
Fetching Data: The Python script pulls match details from the Riot Games API, focusing on Summonersâ€™ last 20 games (and sometimes more if Iâ€™m feeling adventurous).

Storing Data: The data gets stored in a SQL Server database, neatly organized and ready for analysis.

Analyzing Data: The analysis phase is where the magic happens. Iâ€™m using the data to find patterns, compare stats, and figure out how to help players climb the ladder.

Reporting: Eventually, this will all come together in reports that offer actionable insights for players looking to improve.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used

Python: For fetching and processing the data.
SQL Server: To store all the match details and keep things organized.
Riot Games API: The treasure trove of match data.
GitHub Pages: For sharing the journey and findings with the world.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals
Help Players Improve: By providing insights into their gameplay based on real data.
Learn and Grow: As much a personal learning journey as it is a project.
Have Fun: Because if youâ€™re not enjoying the process, whatâ€™s the point?

ðŸŽ‰ The Adventure Continues
This project is still very much a work in progress, and Iâ€™m loving every second of it. There are plenty more surprises and lessons ahead, and I canâ€™t wait to see where it all leads.
